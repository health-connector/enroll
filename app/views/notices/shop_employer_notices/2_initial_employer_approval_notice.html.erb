Payments over the phone or online are required, as they can be processed immediately and will ensure your coverage will not be delayed. Checks are not accepted for the first month of coverage as they cannot be processed in time for your group’s enrollments to be transmitted to your health insurance company.<br>
          If your first month’s premium is not received and cleared by 5:00 p.m. on <%=notice.plan_year.binder_payment_due_date.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")%>, your group’s coverage will be delayed and your employees may experience a gap in coverage. Once enrollments have been processed by the health insurance company, employees will receive information about their health plan directly from the health insurance company, including their ID cards.
